How do I approach designing software?
Since I was learning everything from scratch. I would start by looking at how others have accomplished the work. Based upon examples I would then craft my own.
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This entire class was new so everything learned would be a new skill. 
What design process did you follow for your project work?
No process really just followed the prompts googling along the way to figure out how to do the required things.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
My approach is just to try and fail until the outcome is right. I guess we would call that trial and error. 
How do I approach developing programs?
I like to work backwards as much as possible. With the end goal and work my way up to how to implement the goal.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
As shared it is all new to me I did not think too deeply on the task we really did not have time to delve into they whys behind the functionality. 
How did iteration factor into your development?
I would make a minor change and run the program. I found when I did big sweeping changes I had to restart the project from scratch.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
The approach stayed the same just make it though. 
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I am not sure it can at this rate. You have to learn pretty much everything yourself it seems and dabbling here and there does not really give you any understanding of anything.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I am just glad I finished the class not sure how any of this will help me in the future as I have no full grasp on what just happened.
